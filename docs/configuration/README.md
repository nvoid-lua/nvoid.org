# Configuration

You can configure Nvoid by using the configuration file located in `~/.config/nvim/lua/nvoidrc.lua`

First run that in the terminal  
```bash
touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/nvoidrc.lua
cd ~/.config/nvim/lua
nvim nvoidrc.lua
```
and start by adding the following: 
```lua
local M = {}

return M
```
when you get along the pages add the code between the `local M = {}` and `return M`
